# tridion-practice
A collection of resources for Tridion practitioners

Actually - this isn't really a code repository. It's a wiki/cookbook/patterns repository... 
that also has some working code examples. Your starting point for understanding things should be 
the relevant wiki page, and only then the code. 

So start there...
