# AmbientDataFramework

This utility page shows you an overview of all of the claims in the Ambient Data Framework as well as their values. 
It also allows you to filter to quickly find the claims that you care about.

There are versions available for both ASP.NET and JSP. 
Normally, **you only need to download the ASPX or JSP file** - the rest of the files are loaded from online CDNs.

If you expect to use the pages _without_ an internet connection, you will need to download the JavaScript and CSS files as well and update the include links within the page.
